- [Release engineering Practices](#release-engineering-practices)
- [Contributing](#Contributing)




# Rationale:
The aim of openprocess-and-tools-release is to share knowledge about **Releasing Software**.

It is a curated documentation about release process, tools, workflows, best practices used for Releasing sofware in the opensource world.

# Status:

WIP


# Release engineering:

* **Reproducible builds**:(distros like openSUSE/debian/archlinux etc partecipate on this): 
  Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code
 
 (https://reproducible-builds.org) 
  
*  

# Contributing:

I have opened a few issues for contributors.

In the normal case, if you have any idea/proposal, feel free to open an issue **before sending PRs** to discuss the rationale.



### Note

Software should be driven by rationale and scope.

So this repo is not just a bare list of X tools for release. 

Instead we should focus more on problems/scope and documentation.
