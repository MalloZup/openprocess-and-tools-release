# openprocess-and-tools-release

# Rationale:
The aim of openprocess-and-tools-release is to share knowledge about **Releasing Software**.

It is a curated documentation about release process, tools, workflows, best practices used for Releasing sofware in the opensource world.

# Status:

WIP


## Note
Note: I belive software should be driven by rationale and scope.

So this repo is not just a bare list of X tools. Instead we should focus more on problems/scope and documentation.


# Contributing:

I have opened a few issues for contributors.

In the normal case, if you have any idea/proposal, feel free to open an issue **before sending PRs** to discuss the rationale.
