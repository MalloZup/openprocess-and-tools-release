# openprocess-and-tools-release

# Community:

https://gitter.im/MalloZup-openprocess-and-tools-release/community


# Goals:

- [ ] Document how opensource Distro and Companies do Software release engineering.
- [ ] Create a community of people who are interested and active work on some subjects or help other maintainers/communities.

Rationale:

The aim of openprocess-and-tools-release is to share knowledge about **Releasing Software**.
It is a curated documentation about release process, tools, workflows, best practices used for Releasing sofware in the opensource world.

# Release engineering:

* [Freebsd Release engineering](doc/freebsd.md)


* [Reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) 
  Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code
 
  

# Contributing:

I have opened a few issues for contributors.

In the normal case, if you have any idea/proposal, feel free to open an issue **before sending PRs** to discuss the rationale.


### Note

Software should be driven by rationale and scope.

So this repo is not just a bare list of X tools for release. 

Instead we should focus more on problems/scope and documentation.
