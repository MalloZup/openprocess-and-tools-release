# openprocess-and-tools-release

# Community:

https://gitter.im/MalloZup-openprocess-and-tools-release/community



# Goals:

- [ ] Document how opensource Distro and Companies do Software release engineering.
- [ ] Create a community of people who are interested and active work on some subjects or help other maintainers/communities.
 
# Rationale:
The aim of openprocess-and-tools-release is to share knowledge about **Releasing Software**.

It is a curated documentation about release process, tools, workflows, best practices used for Releasing sofware in the opensource world.

# Status:

WIP


# Release engineering Practices:

* Reproducible builds (https://reproducible-builds.org) 
  TODO: dive more on the subject with examples




## Note

Software should be driven by rationale and scope.

So this repo is not just a bare list of X tools for release. 

Instead we should focus more on problems/scope and documentation.


# Contributing:

I have opened a few issues for contributors.

In the normal case, if you have any idea/proposal, feel free to open an issue **before sending PRs** to discuss the rationale.
