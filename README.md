# openprocess-and-tools-release


The aim of openprocess-and-tools-release is to share knowledge about **Releasing Software**.

It is a curated documentation about release process, tools, workflows, best practices used for Releasing sofware in the opensource world.

Note: I belive software should be driven by rationale and scope.

So this repo is not just a bare list of X tools. Instead we should focus more on problems/scope and documentation.
